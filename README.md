WindowsAzure.Messaging.iOS
==========================

Xamarin.iOS binding for the Microsoft WindowsAzure.Messaging SDK for iOS

This is a first version that tries to mimick the .NET version of the API, but with the Objective-C library underneath.

Used http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj927169.aspx as a starting point.

No guarantees.
